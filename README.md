# Flight Booking Process
This code simulates a flight booking through frquent flyer program.
There are 2 programs: Gold and Silver Passenger. They benefit a higher miles factor when they book a ticket.
A traveler must first register, either as Gold or Silver or just as "normal" passenger.
The data of every Gold and Silver passenger is kept as a Passenger type, which contains an id and a current bank account. Current miles are set to 0.

In every purchase the price of the ticket is redeemed from the traveler's bank account.

This code contains method translations from the Java code, and aims to implement OOP concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and substitutability as much as possible



We start with a simple example to test the code

> Deposit: 0 + 98 = 98

> passenger #31 booked a ticket. <br />
Price: $40 <br />
Miles: 40.00 <br />
Current in account: $58 <br />


Polymorphism is the ability of a value of certain type to also be of another type

## Substitutability
