# Flight Booking Process
This code simulates flight booking through frequent flyer program. There are 2 categories: Gold and Silver Passenger.

This code contains method translations from the Java code, and aims to implement OO concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and substitutability as much as possible.
The process: A traveler must first register, either as Gold or Silver or just as "normal" passenger with an ID, with certain amount of money, or he can add later with a function _addToBankAccount_.
For the ID assignment: Gold members passnegers start with 1#, silver members passengers start with 2# and normal passengers start with 3#. Every ID is inserted into a list, after checking if this ID already exists.

```
func (p *Passenger) newPassenger(id int, bankAccount int) {
	if isValid(id) {
		id_list.PushBack(id)
		p.id = id
		p.bankAccount = bankAccount
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("ID %d already exists\n", id)
	}
}
```

To start a new booking process, we must use the function _newTravel_. This function calls the functions of the interface _flightTicket_, which are _bookATicket_ and _getLoungeVoucher_.

### Booking policy
When booking a ticket, every passengerâ€™s bank account is being checked if there is enough money to cover the ticket price. Then the amount is redeemed from the bank account.

### Miles earnings policy
The miles that are added to the passenger's data is the price of the ticket.
Gold and silver members benefit a factor 0.5 and 0.25 respectively. These are set with the global variables goldfac and silverfac.


### Lounge access policy
Gold Passengers get free access.
Silver passengers get an access for $20, if there is a sufficient amount in the bank account.



We start with a simple example to test the code.
A passenger is registering as ID=31 and adds money to the bank account

``` 
pass := Passenger{} 
pass.newPassenger(31, 0) 
addToBankAccount(&pass, 98)
``` 



Output:
``` 
 Deposit: 0 + 98 = $98 
``` 
start a new travel:
``` 
 newTravel(&pass, 40)
``` 

Output:

``` 
Passenger #31 booked a ticket.
Price: $40
Miles: 40.00
Current in account (after transaction): $58
``` 

Then we try to book an expensive ticket for the passenger
``` 
newTravel(&pass, 60)
``` 

Output:
``` 
Booking for Passenger #31 has failed.
Ticket Price: $60 
Current: $58
``` 
Every registration of a passenger is done in the (p *Passenger)newPassenger(int,int) function. Gold and Silver Registrations are being directed to this function.
moving on to gold passenger #11. This time when registering the bank account is set to $98. Then he purchases a $40 ticket. He also gets a free lounge access.
``` 
gp := GoldPassenger{}
gp.newPassenger(11, 98)
``` 
Miles earning for gold and silver members is done within two steps, first as a regular passenger and then according to their policy in their function.
So here 40 * (1 + 0.5) is 60. That means the gold passenger collected 60 miles.
Gold passengers also get a message that they have a free access to the lounge.

``` 
newTravel(&gp, 40)
``` 

Output:
``` 
Passenger #11 booked a ticket.
Price: $40
Miles: 60.00
Current in account (after transaction): $58

Passenger #11 gets a free lounge access
``` 


Letâ€™s try to create a silver passenger #21
``` 
sil := SilverPassenger{}
sil.newPassenger(21, 0)
addToBankAccount(&sil, 70)
newTravel(&sil, 20)
``` 
A silver passenger gets access to the lounge with a $20 fee. 
``` 
Passenger #21 booked a ticket.
Price: $20
Miles: 25.00
Current in account (after transaction): $50

For entering the lounge passenger #21 paid $20. Current in account: $30
``` 



When we book another ticket, this passenger doesn't get any notice about a lounge

``` 
newTravel(&sil, 20)
``` 
Output
``` 
Passenger #21 booked a ticket.
Price: $20
Miles: 50.00
Current in account (after transaction): $10

For entering the lounge passenger #21 paid $20. Current in account: $10
``` 
Then we add $25 to the bank account and try to purchase a $40 ticket

``` 
addToBankAccount(&sil, 25)
newTravel(&sil, 40)
``` 
Output:
``` 
Deposit of passenger #21: 10 + 25 = $35

Booking for Passenger #21 has failed.
Ticket Price: $40 
Current: $35

For entering the lounge passenger #21 paid $20. Current in account: $15
``` 

The passenger gets a message that he failed to book a ticket because of insufficient amount but still got charged for $20 to get access to the lounge.
This problem occurred again with the gold passenger, but luckily, he wasnâ€™t charged ðŸ¤“:

``` 
gp2 := GoldPassenger{}
gp2.newPassenger(12, 20)
newTravel(&gp2, 50)
```
Output:
``` 
Booking for Passenger #12 has failed.
Ticket Price: $50 
Current: $20

Passenger #12 gets a free lounge access
``` 
### Insights about the code
Unfortunately, gold and silver passengers have an additional and unnecessary check for their ticket price and bank account. This is because they are being referenced to _func (p *Passenger) bookATicket(price int)_.

Implementing the Liskov substitution principle was done almost successfully. There is a call to get lounge voucher for normal passengers - which is our super class. But since according to the policy he's not allowed to enter the lounge, he doesn't get any message. This is done with an empty function:

```
func (p *Passenger) getLoungeVoucher() {}
```

when we register a passenger with an ID that already exists, The assigned ID is 0. But the object referenced to this passenger is different from the other passengerâ€™s object with the same ID. There should be an error handling of this case.


```
pass2 := Passenger{}
pass2.newPassenger(31, 0) // #31 already exists
addToBankAccount(&pass2, 98)
newTravel(&pass2, 40)
```
Output:

```  
ID 31 already exists
Deposit of passenger #0: 0 + 98 = $98

Passenger #0 booked a ticket.
Price: $40
Miles: 40.00
Current in account (after transaction): $58

```

In the case of adding cash to bank account with the function addToBankAccount, because this a secure and simple operation for all passengers, I thought it would be efficient to write all in one function without any referencing like in other methods.
A multiple receiver for all different passengers in one function is not possible. Therefore I used the empty interface{}.
It was too much repetitiveness like this case of gold and silver passengers:

```
case *GoldPassenger:
    t1 = v.pass.bankAccount
    v.pass.bankAccount += amount
    t2 = v.pass.bankAccount
    id = v.pass.id	
case *SilverPassenger:
    t1 = v.pass.bankAccount
    v.pass.bankAccount += amount
    t2 = v.pass.bankAccount
    id = v.pass.id
```



Overall, it was possible to implement OO principles with GO.
